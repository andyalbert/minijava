My part is done except this part ExpressionBar ::= ExpressionRestExpressionBar | lambda, I don't know if how i handled the lambda is correct 
There is an error in my code that is coz i am using class expression which hasn't been built yet (abdo's part)
there are two syntax mistakes at the grammar rules in my part:Andrew plz fix Those 
1)
ExpressionBar ::= ExpressionRestExpressionBar | lambda
 to be 
ExpressionBar ::= Expression RestExpressionBar | lambda

2)
ExpressionRestNew ::=  " "int" "[" Expression "]"
			| Identifier "(" ")"
to be 
ExpressionRestNew ::=   "int" "[" Expression "]"
			| Identifier "(" ")"
